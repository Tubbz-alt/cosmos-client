# Cosmos Client

The goal of this project is to create a multi-platform client for blockchain applications built
with the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

It is written primarily in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) so that we can use a single code-base
to create clients for JS, Android, iOS, and more via Kotlin's [Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html)
support.
